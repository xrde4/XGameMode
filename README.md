<br> ‚úîÔ∏è It saves the inventory for each mode, preventing players from accumulating items in creative mode and then switching.
<br> ‚úîÔ∏è You can use the /gm command for your generous donors, but don't forget about me ü•π.
<br> ‚úîÔ∏è If a player switches modes using some external method, the plugin prevents them from using /gm to switch back, as this could potentially lead to item duplication.
<br> ‚úîÔ∏è Dual Language Support: The XGamemode plugin comes with built-in support for two languages directly from the source code, making it easy to cater to a broader player base with different language preferences.

#### :question: Why did **XGameMode** appear?

I'm aware that similar plugins existed in earlier versions, but the removal of Item::jsonDeserialize in PM5 resulted in the incompatibility and decline of those previous plugins. XGameMode employs a slightly different approach, ensuring its relevance in the current environment and hopefully in future updates as well. (Stay strong, and best of luck with your efforts!)
